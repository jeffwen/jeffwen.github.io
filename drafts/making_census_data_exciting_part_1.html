    <p><em>February 27, 2016</em></p>
<p>This post will be a bit lengthy and cover some details that might not be that interesting but I am also using this post as a way to capture the process so I don't forget things.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this post, I will discuss some of the deisgn decisions that I made while working on this project and also go through some of the set up required to get things up and running. To start off with the goal of this project was to take census data and use it and visualize it in an interesting way.</p>
<p>While I did not really have a clear idea when I started the project, I worked with a couple of my teammates to come up with an overall plan. We had to use <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income">census data</a> and also had to think about how to tell a story with that data using classification models and D3.js. With this said, we really racked our brains to try to figure out how to use the data in an interesting way. I think we eventually did and will share more in the upcoming 2 posts!</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>One of the tools that I wanted to start playing around with was Amazon's EC2 servers because the trial version is free for the first year and I also wanted to learn the technology! However, the set up for the EC2 server was actually not as straight forward as I would have imagined. Particularly because I wanted to use PostgreSQL and directly connect to the server to pull data into my local machine to analyze with Python (Psycopg2 to the rescue).</p>
<h4>Amazon Instance</h4>
<p>Anyways, the first step was to create the EC2 instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that you have an AWS account and select a region that makes sense (in my case US West)</li>
<li>Choose one of the configurations that you want (my teammates and I chose Ubuntu)</li>
<li>Select a "free tier" instance ("t2.micro" for me!)</li>
<li>Walk through the setup process by following the prompts</li>
<li>Setup security groups</li>
<li>This part was a bit confusing because PostgreSQL required another port to allow connections from my local machine's Python (will talk more about this later)</li>
<li>Choose to "Create a new key pair" and give it a name</li>
<li>Download your .pem file.</li>
<li>Move the file somewhere sensible like ~/.ssh/.</li>
<li>Make the file read only with chmod 400 filename</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the server is set up and can be accessed using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_cool_machine.pem ubuntu@123.234.123.234
</pre></div>


<h4>Loading the tools and getting things ready</h4>
<p>At this point we needed to get a couple packages onto the server and </p>
