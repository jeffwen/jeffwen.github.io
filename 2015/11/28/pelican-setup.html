    <h3><a href="http://jeffwen.github.io/2015/11/28/pelican-setup">Setting up the blog</a></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p><em>November 28, 2015</em></p>
<p>Over the past couple of days, I have been working towards getting a blog up and running. There were a couple of different options that I was considering and ultimately I ended up choosing to use <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> as my site generator. I also use GitHub Pages to host my blog for free!</p>
<h3>Decisions</h3>
<p>Initially, I was considering just sticking with Jekyll, which is the site generator that pairs really nicely with the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">GitHub Pages</a>. However, I read a couple different posts by other users, thought about the decision, and noticed the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ruby vs. Python</em>: Jekyll is Ruby based whereas Pelican is Python based.</p>
<ul>
<li>While I am also picking up Ruby, I am definitely more comfortable with Python at this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Speed</em>: While I am still new to blogging and don't necessarily feel the struggle of slow page loading (given that I don't have much experience with slow loading blogs), <a href="http://arunrocks.com/moving-blogs-to-pelican/">this user's</a> blog post was definitely persuasive enough for me to take speed into consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Personal Growth</em>: Jekyll might have been easier to use given that it is integrated with GitHub so well, but I wanted to (at least in my mind at the time) learn a little bit more by using something that required just a little more work. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>With these things in mind, I decided to jump right in and start setting up my blog. While it was quite simple for the most part, it definitely took some time figuring everything out because I was trying to use a couple different resources to make sure that by blog would run smoothly. Looking back on it, I guess it probably would have been better to stick with one solid resource vs. trying to merge different ways of doing the same thing. However, as stated before, I wanted to learn as much as possible and see the different ways people were setting up their blogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources:<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/">Pelican Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html">Amy Halon's blog post on GitHub Pages Migration</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/">Fedora Magazine's blog post on GitHub Pages and Pelican</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I was following some of the resources mentioned earlier, I realized that It was a great opportunity for me to also learn more about other technologies as well. For example, I read up on GitHub submodules because Fedora's post mentioned initiaizing the output directory as a submodule. I am getting my hands dirty with Markdown because I am using Markdown to write these blog posts and pages. Additionally, HTML and CSS are relevant as well because I am learning to customize my blog.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>It may seem that this blog post is rather short and ending prematurely, but I have only started to blog and so I hope that as I learn more about Pelican and blogging I will share more of my learnings and thoughts!</p>
